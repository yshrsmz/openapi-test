# Development Log - OpenAPI Kotlin Code Generator

## Session Summary

### Initial State
- Basic project structure with Gradle setup
- Design document outlining requirements
- No implementation started

### Development Process

#### Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Infrastructure
1. **Created Gradle Plugin Structure**
   - Set up `openapikotlin-gradle-plugin` module
   - Configured plugin ID and implementation class
   - Added necessary dependencies

2. **Implemented Clean Architecture**
   - Domain layer with models and interfaces
   - Application layer with use cases
   - Infrastructure layer with implementations

#### Phase 2: Basic Code Generation
1. **Model Generation**
   - Started with simple data class generation
   - Added support for required/optional properties
   - Implemented proper type mapping

2. **Client Generation**
   - Basic Ktor client setup
   - HTTP method implementation
   - Parameter handling (path, query, header)

#### Phase 3: Bug Fixes and Enhancements
1. **Fixed Regex Issues**
   - Unescaped braces in path parameter regex
   - Changed from `{(.+?)}` to `\\{(.+?)\\}`

2. **Fixed KotlinPoet Issues**
   - Removed private modifiers from constructor parameters
   - Fixed wildcard imports
   - Proper type resolution

3. **Fixed Name Handling**
   - Reserved keyword wrapping with backticks
   - Header name conversion (X-Request-ID â†’ xRequestId)
   - CamelCase preservation for existing camelCase names

#### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. **Enum Generation**
   - Fixed to generate enums for primitive types with enum values
   - Added nested enum generation for inline property enums

2. **Special Types**
   - Created SpecialTypesGenerator for undefined types
   - Handles types like NullUUID, Time, Duration

3. **Schema Composition**
   - Implemented allOf with property merging
   - Added oneOf with sealed interfaces
   - Basic anyOf with wrapper classes
   - Recursive resolution for nested compositions

### Key Challenges Solved

1. **Type Resolution**
   - Created OperationContext to carry HTTP method and path
   - Proper handling of nullable types
   - Collection type mapping

2. **Import Management**
   - Recursive schema traversal for import collection
   - Avoiding wildcard imports
   - Proper package resolution

3. **Schema Composition**
   - Recursive allOf resolution
   - Interface implementation tracking for oneOf
   - Reference resolution across schemas

### Testing Approach
- TDD methodology throughout
- Started with failing tests
- Implemented features to pass tests
- Added integration tests with real specs

### Current State
- **42 tests**: 41 passing, 1 skipped
- Successfully generates code for complex real-world APIs (Ory)
- All major features implemented except "separate clients by tags"

## Lessons Learned

1. **KotlinPoet Quirks**
   - Constructor parameters can't have visibility modifiers
   - Wildcard imports not allowed
   - Need to be careful with nullable type handling

2. **OpenAPI Complexity**
   - Many specs have undefined types (especially from Go)
   - Schema composition can be deeply nested
   - Property names need careful handling

3. **Testing is Crucial**
   - Real-world specs reveal many edge cases
   - Integration tests catch interaction issues
   - TDD helps design better APIs

## Future Considerations

1. **Performance**
   - Current implementation parses spec multiple times
   - Could cache parsed results
   - Parallel generation possible

2. **Extensibility**
   - Plugin system for custom generators
   - Hook points for customization
   - Template support

3. **Error Handling**
   - Better error messages needed
   - Validation before generation
   - Recovery from partial failures
